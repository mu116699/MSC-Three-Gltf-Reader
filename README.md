The GIF above demonstrates the basic usage rules of the software, which mainly include the following two aspects:
    1.View Manipulation: Right-click with the mouse to move and rotate the view; use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the view; right-click again to perform movement operations.
    2. Model Selection and Editing: Click on a model to select its components. If multiple models intersect, the topmost component will be selected. Once selected, you can modify the features of the selected components. To deselect, simply click the right mouse button.

Here are some additional relevant details about the software:
    1. Two material options are provided: Metal and Glass. "None" indicates that only the color will be modified without altering other properties of the original object.
    2.The "glb Sample" folder offers some glb models for reference. GLB (GL Transmission Format) and glTF (GL Transmission Format) are two file formats commonly used in the field of 3D graphics and rendering.
    3.The parameters "Clearcoat" and "ClearcoatRoughness" in the dialog box are properties used for material rendering in Three.js. For specific usage details, please refer to the official Three.js documentation.

For the next step of development:
The software will support features such as saving edited gltf files, aligning billboard views, and applying texture mapping. It should be noted that the models are initially edited using Blender software and then exported as glb files.

The provided installation package:
Two Windows installation packages have been compiled and are available for download and use.
